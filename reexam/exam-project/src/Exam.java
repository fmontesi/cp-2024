/*
This is the reexam for DM584 - Concurrent Programming, Spring 2024.

Your task is to implement the following methods of class Exam:
- findLineUniqueWords;
- lineWithMostA;
- wordWithConsonants;
- wordsWithSubstring.

These methods search text files for particular words.
You must use a BreakIterator to identify words in a text file,
which you can obtain by calling BreakIterator.getWordInstance().
For more details on the usage of BreakIterator, please see the corresponding video lecture in the
course.

The implementations of these methods must exploit concurrency to achieve improved performance.

The only code that you can change is the implementation of these methods.
In particular, you cannot change the signatures (return type, name, parameters) of any method, and
you cannot edit method main.
The current code of these methods throws an UnsupportedOperationException: remove that line before
proceeding on to the implementation.

You can find a complete explanation of the exam rules at the following webpage.

	 * Return all words that appear exactly once (at least once and no more) in any line of the files contained in the given directory. If a word appears exactly once in two (or more) different lines of the same file, you should return it twice (or more). Each returned word must not appear more than once in its line. So if a word, say "Hello", appears exactly once in lines 5 and 10 of a file "f1.txt", then the list should contain two entries (one for each occurrence of Hello in the two lines).
	 *
	 * This method recursively visits a directory to find text files contained in it
	 * and its subdirectories (and the subdirectories of these subdirectories,
	 * etc.).
	 *
	 * You must consider only files ending with a ".txt" suffix. You are guaranteed
	 * that they will be text files.
	 *
	 * The method should return a list of LocatedWord objects (defined by the class
	 * at the end of this file), where each LocatedWord object should consist of:
	 * - a word appearing only on one line of the file;
	 * - the line containing such word;
	 * - the path to the file containing such line.
	 *
	 * All words appearing exactly once in a line of some file must appear in the list: words
	 * that can be in the list must be in the list.
	 *
	 * Words must be considered equal without considering differences between
	 * uppercase and lowercase letters. (Case insensitive.) For example, the words "Hello", "hEllo" and
	 * "HELLo" must be considered equal to the word "hello".
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Allowed concurrency strategies: executors, completion services, and futures (including any combination of these strategies).
	 *
	 * @param dir the directory to search
	 * @return a list of words that, within a file inside dir, appear on only one line

	 * The method should return the line which counts the highest number of occurrences of the letter 'a' (counting also 'A') found among all text files. The line must not be one of the first 10 lines of the file it is in.
	 * If multiple lines are identified as having the highest number in the same file, just return the line that comes first. If two files have lines with the same (highest) number, then return the file whose filepath comes first lexicographically. (Use the full path, or 'absolute path' in Java, or you will not compare correctly files with the same name in different directories.)
	 * To compare strings lexicographically, you can use String::compareTo.
	 * See also https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String)
